With FireCheck, you will know if you are in danger from any fires up to 15 days in advance by checking the probability of fires before they begin- allowing you to pack necessities and get to safety!
## Inspiration
There are many applications allowing people to determine where an existing fire is located and which direction it is traveling in, but there are no applications that allow a person to determine the probability of a fire occuring their location before the fire starts. FireCheck allows people to determine the likelihood of a fire in their specific area with realtime updates. Often, information about fires are outdated unless the fire is currently happening. Most times, areas are simply marked as fire hazards without actually considering the current weather conditions. Instead, it simply looks at historical data and marks an area as a hazard for the entire fire season. Moreover, evacuation alerts have been sent to entire areas instead of just the specific city that needs to evacuate. Recently, the entire LA population was sent an evacuation notice that led to worry until another notification correcting the mistake was finally sent. FireCheck uses updated conditions to determine the amount of fire danger a specific city is currently in, regardless of whether it is fire season, and the specific probabilities allow users to prepare well in advance of the fire and evacuate safely with help from our chatbot.
